# 3DPointsFrom2DImages
calculate 3D points from 2D images which helps in 3d Model generation


There are two main files in it.
0) Assumed that you founf the camera intrinsic property matrix.
a) core script sample execution to show main function signature.
b) file contatining the functions that are used to find 3D ponints corressponding to 2D image points.


Note: The code has been developed assuming greyscale 2D images.
